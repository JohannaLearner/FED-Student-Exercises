      <h1>Welcome to my learning portfolio</h1>
      <p>
          Hi, my name is Jo. 
          This site is a learning portfolio. I'm recording here the assignments I have as part of the Purple Beard Front End Development Course.
      </p>
      <p>The free 16 week course in Front End Web Development is part of a range of training courses delivered by <a href="https://purplebeard.co.uk/"   >Purple Beard Training</a> and <a href="https://skillsforlife.campaign.gov.uk/?utm_source=Google&utm_medium=PPC&utm_campaign=AdultSkills23_202301_0_All&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIwI_TyYz5_QIVTtTtCh35mgL5EAAYASAAEgLVo_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds" >the Skills for Life campaign</a>.</p>
      <h2>
          What does the Front End Web development course include:</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>html</li>
          <li>css</li>
          <li>javascript</li>
          <li>react</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Employability Skills</h2>
        <p>The course also includes sessions to make learners ready for the job market, eventual employment or self-employment. Employability sessions include subjects such as </p>
          <ul>
            <li>CV writing</li>
            <li> Making the most out of LinkedIN</li>
            <li>soft skills such as developing a growth mindset and managing conflict among other essentials for surviving and thriving as an employee or as an entrepreneur or sole trader</li>
          </ul>
        
          <p>I'm grateful to be offered the opportunity to consolidate and further my front end web development skills. It will be invaluable in my role as a self-employed web developer.
