        Hi, I'm going to struggle my way through some flex examples here. I have
        to say I'm getting myself very very confused. So far in my learning
        journey I am struggling with flex. There are so many different options
        and then of course there are flex items which have their own options.
      </p>
      <p>
        For reference, I have taken these examples from W3C schools and other
        resources, they are not my creations.
