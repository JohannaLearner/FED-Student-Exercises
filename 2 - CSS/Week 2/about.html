            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Barrington CIC is a proactive community and philanthropic leader dedicated to improving the quality of life for young people not in education, employment or training especially for people facing the greatest disadvantages and for the most vulnerable.

        
            </p>
            <p>We manage funds donated by individuals and organisations, building endowment and acting as the vital link between donors and local needs, connecting people with causes, and enabling clients to achieve far more than they could ever by themselves.</p>
                <p>We target those funds to groups and community interest communitys working with young people</p>
